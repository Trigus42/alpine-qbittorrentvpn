Docker container which runs the latest qBittorrent-nox client while connecting to WireGuard or OpenVPN with netfilter killswitch to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel goes down.

## Features

* Netfilter **killswitch** to prevent IP leaking when VPN connection fails
* Selectively enable or disable **WireGuard** or **OpenVPN** support
* **IPv6** support
* Configurable **UID** and **GID** for config files and /downloads for qBittorrent
* Build for **amd64**, **arm64**, **armv8** and **armv7**
* ...

# Run container:

* Modify one of the [example compose files](docs/examples/compose) to your needs.
* [Create the necessary VPN config files](#vpn-configuration).

Then start the container by running:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Volumes
| Volume | Required | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|

## VPN Configuration
If there are multiple config files present, one will be choosen randomly.

## WireGuard 
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid `INTERFACE.conf` file present in the `/config/wireguard` directory. Drop a `.conf` file from your VPN provider into `/config/wireguard` and start the container again.

> Recommended INTERFACE names include `wg0` or `wgvpn0` or even `wgmgmtlan0`. However, the number at the end is in fact optional, and really any free-form string `[a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15}` will work. So even interface names corresponding to geographic locations would suffice, such as `cincinnati`, `nyc`, or `paris`, if that's somehow desirable.

## OpenVPN
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid `FILENAME.ovpn` file present in the `/config/openvpn` directory. Drop a `.ovpn` file from your VPN provider into `/config/openvpn` (if necessary with additional files like certificates) and start the container.  

You can either use the environment variables `VPN_USERNAME` and `VPN_PASSWORD` or store your credentials in `openvpn/credentials.conf`. Those credentials will be used to create credential files for all VPN configs initially. 
If you manually store your VPN credentials in `openvpn/FILENAME_credentials.conf`, those will be used for the particular VPN config.

#### Example credentials file
```
YOURUSERNAME
YOURPASSWORD
```

## PUID/PGID
User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:

```sh
id <username>
```

# Customization
Just mount your script to `/etc/cont-init.d/your_script.sh` in the container. The execution order is determined by the number prefix.  

See [docs/examples/scripts](docs/examples/scripts) for examples.  

Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that variables used in the default scripts or the execution order stay the same. Please try to make your custom scripts independent of those things.

# Build it yourself
&NewLine;
You can use the `Dockerfile` with all architectures and versions of qBT that are listed [here](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases).

If you don't specify any tags, the latest release version will be used.

&NewLine;
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Trigus42/alpine-qbittorrentvpn.git
$ cd alpine-qbittorrentvpn
$ QBITTORRENT_TAG={TAG} docker build -f Dockerfile -t qbittorrentvpn .
```

Build for all supported architectures:
```
$ QBITTORRENT_TAG={TAG} docker buildx bake -f bake.yml
```

If you want to use this command to push the images to a registry (append `--push` to the above command), you have to modify the `image` setting in `bake.yml`.

# Reporting Issues

When encountering an issue, please first attempt to reproduce it using the most up-to-date stable versions of Docker, your operating system, kernel, and the container itself.

Before opening a new issue, please refer to previously reported issues as well as the [common issues](docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.md). Your issue might have already been addressed, or there may be ongoing discussions that you can join.

Upon opening an issue, kindly provide the following details:

- Full logs from container boot to exit, preferably with the `DEBUG=yes` environment variable set.
- Your Docker compose file or Docker run command.
- Depending on your situation, other relevant information such as:
  - The image where the issue first arose. Including tag information such as date and commit hash can be immensely useful, especially if you suspect that a recent change may have introduced the problem.
  - Your VPN config file, with any keys and other sensitive information removed.
  - Any additional details that may be relevant to your specific situation.

While logs should not display passwords and keys, it is highly recommended to review them for any sensitive information. Depending on your particular case, you might also want to redact IP addresses and domain names.
